Privacy Policy:
Lux Icon Pack doesn't collect any information by default. The app is fully usable without an internet connection (except for downloading wallpapers).

However, when you request an icon, by default, some data is gathered when you send the request. You have the option to customize the information sent in the email:

The email address from which you send the request
Details such as manufacturer, model, product name, screen resolution, and Android version of your phone
App version & Candybar version (the app dashboard)
Name and ComponentInfo of the app whose icon you want
The same process applies for bug reporting, but additionally, we collect names and ComponentInfos of all installed apps on your phone for debugging purposes.

This information is exclusively used for handling icon requests and remains private. You have full control over the data you choose to send to us via email.

If you have any inquiries or suggestions regarding our Privacy Policy, feel free to reach out to us.
